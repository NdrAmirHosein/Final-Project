📚 Data Structures and Algorithms – Final Project
This project follows the MVC architecture and is structured in layers:

Interface (UI) <-> Services <-> Handler <-> Database

⚙️ Project Structure
Interface: User-facing interface 
Services: Core business logic
Handler: Bridges services and data access
Database: Handles data storage and retrieval


🚀 Running the App
To start the application, simply run:

pip install requirements
then
python main.py
Note: The app uses fake test data for demonstration purposes.

🎨 UI/UX Notice
The UI and UX design are not fully complete. Some frontend components were generated using AI tools due to the developer’s primary focus on backend and logic implementation(Lack of intrest in Front End :D).
